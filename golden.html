          <!--Description of dog-->
          Golden Retrievers are among the most beloved and iconic dog breeds
          worldwide, renowned for their beautiful golden coats and gentle,
          friendly disposition. Originating from Scotland in the 19th century,
          these dogs were initially bred for retrieving game in hunting
          expeditions. Today, they are cherished family pets, known for their
          intelligence, patience, and an eagerness to please. Their amiable
          nature makes them excellent companions, especially for children, and
          their intelligence and trainability have made them popular choices for
          various roles, including search and rescue, assistance dogs, and
          therapy dogs. Golden Retrievers are not just pets; they are loyal
          friends and dedicated members of the families they join, bringing joy,
          warmth, and endless affection.
